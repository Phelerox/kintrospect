 # Kintrospect

A commonplace book system for Kindle highlights. Also, a sandbox to experiment with React and Electron.

This project uses the [electron-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate).

## Install

* **Note: requires a node version >= 6 and an npm version >= 3.**
* **If you have installation or compilation issues with this project, please see [our debugging guide](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate/issues/400)**

First, clone the repo via git:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate.git your-project-name
```

And then install dependencies.
**ProTip**: Install with [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn) for faster and safer installation

```bash
$ cd your-project-name && npm install
```

:bulb: *In order to remove boilerplate sample code, simply run `npm run cleanup`. After this is run, the initial sample boilerplate code will be removed in order for a clean project for starting custom dev*

## Run

Run these two commands __simultaneously__ in different console tabs.

```bash
$ npm run hot-server
$ npm run start-hot
```

or run two servers with one command

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

## Editor Configuration
**Atom**
```bash
apm install editorconfig es6-javascript atom-ternjs javascript-snippets linter linter-eslint language-babel autocomplete-modules file-icons
```

## Packaging

To package apps for the local platform:

```bash
$ npm run package
```

To package apps for all platforms:

First, refer to [Multi Platform Build](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Multi-Platform-Build) for dependencies.

Then,
```bash
$ npm run package-all
```

To package apps with options:

```bash
$ npm run package -- --[option]
```

## Further commands

To run the application without packaging run

```bash
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

To run End-to-End Test

```bash
$ npm run build
$ npm run test-e2e
```

#### Options

See [electron-builder CLI Usage](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder#cli-usage)

#### Module Structure

This boilerplate uses a [two package.json structure](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder/wiki/Two-package.json-Structure).

1. If the module is native to a platform or otherwise should be included with the published package (i.e. bcrypt, openbci), it should be listed under `dependencies` in `./app/package.json`.
2. If a module is `import`ed by another module, include it in `dependencies` in `./package.json`.   See [this ESLint rule](https://github.com/benmosher/eslint-plugin-import/blob/master/docs/rules/no-extraneous-dependencies.md).
3. Otherwise, modules used for building, testing and debugging should be included in `devDependencies` in `./package.json`.

## Static Type Checking
This project comes with Flow support out of the box! You can annotate your code with types, [get Flow errors as ESLint errors](https://github.com/amilajack/eslint-plugin-flowtype-errors), and get [type errors during runtime](https://github.com/codemix/flow-runtime) during development. Types are completely optional.

## Native-like UI

If you want to have native-like User Interface (OS X El Capitan and Windows 10), [react-desktop](https://github.com/gabrielbull/react-desktop) may perfect suit for you.

## Dispatching redux actions from main process

see discusses in [#118](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate/issues/118) and [#108](https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate/issues/108)

## How to keep the boilerplate updated

If your application is a fork from this repo, you can add this repo to another git remote:

```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate.git
```

Then, use git to merge some latest commits:

```sh
git pull upstream master
```
